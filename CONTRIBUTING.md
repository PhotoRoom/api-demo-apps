GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs, discussing features and general feedback about the demo aps. Be sure to check the API [presentation page](https://www.photoroom.com/api), [documentation](https://docs.photoroom.com/docs/api) and [past issues](https://github.com/PhotoRoom/api-demo-apps/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.
